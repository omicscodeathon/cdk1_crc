Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
. Search and download public databases (PubChem) for ligands as potential inhibitors
. Import into Schrodinger suite releasse 2018-4 (Maestro 11.8) for ligand preparation using LigPrep wizard of software
. Determine drug-likeness of ligands using SwissADME
. Search and download as a .pdb file the crystallographic 3D structure of Cdk1 (4Y72)
. Prepare protein using Protein preparation wizard of software (add hydrogen bonds, remove water molecules above 5A, assign bonds etc)
. Determine binding pocket of protein using receptor grid generation feature
. Perform docking of optimized protein-ligand complex and validate
. Determine MM-GBSA of docked complex using VSGB and OPLS3 field force
. Perform molecular dynamics simulation on AceCloud 
. Perform steps 8 - 10 for remaining ligands to determine best scoring docked complex
  Present and interpret results
